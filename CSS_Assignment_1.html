<h1>Super Mom</h1>

<p class="ABC">Mom, you're a wonderful mother,<br>So gentle, yet so strong.<br>The many ways you show you care<br>Always make me feel I belong.</p>
<p class="ABC">You're patient when I'm foolish;<br>You give guidance when I ask;<br>It seems you can do most anything;<br>You're the master of every task</p>
<p  class="ABC">You're a dependable source of comfort;<br>You're my cushion when I fall.<br>You help in times of trouble;<br>You support me whenever I call.</p>
<p  class="ABC">--By Joanna Fuchs</p>
